**Aim**:
To develop a motion-triggered alert system using IoT sensors and surveillance devices, simulated in Cisco Packet Tracer.

**Problem Statement**:
Develop an advanced alert system utilizing motion detection and the surveillance infrastructure to promptly notify the user of any detected motion, implemented through Cisco Packet Tracer.

**Scope**:
- Detect motion using simulated PIR sensors.
- Trigger alerts to smart devices (tablet/PC).
- Activate surveillance camera upon detection.
- Scalable for industrial or home security applications.
- Fully simulated using Cisco Packet Tracerâ€™s IoT environment.

  **Required Components**:
- **IDE/Simulator**: Cisco Packet Tracer (IoT mode)
- **Software**: Embedded scripting (JavaScript or block-based logic)
- **Hardware (Simulated)**:
  - PIR Motion Sensor
  - MCU-PT (Microcontroller)
  - IP Camera
  - Wireless Router
  - Smart Tablet or PC
